# Data Cleaning

Things to clean:
1. Change Column Names
2. Typecast numbers to int
3. Decide if margin of errors want to be kept (might need to make it another column if so) + condense dataframe

```{r}
df = earnings %>% 
  mutate(X = lag(X, n = 1, default = NA))

females = df[, 38:ncol(df)] #gets only the columns for females

#adds some of the column names so that we can use the names function
females[3,10] = "Science and Engineering Related Fields"
females[3,11] = 'Business'
females[3,12] = 'Education'
females[3,1] = 'Total'

#combines the females with the states column
females = cbind(df[,1], females)
females[3,1] = 'States'

#gets only the rows and columns wihtout nas

#you can change the by to get all of the errors instead
females = females[seq(1, nrow(df), by = 3),]

# Question 1: What is the Gender Gap By Major Across The Country?

diverging bar chart: https://r-charts.com/part-whole/diverging-bar-chart-ggplot2/
Up is increase male, down is increase female. Likely won't be much down but that's the point
show equal y-axis on both sides to exacerbate the difference
group my major. Each bar represents a different major. Leave out Multidisciplinary studies due to NAs
Allow grouped bars (dodge) to show up to 3(?) different states for comparison
color by state?
scale_fill_gradient by amount?
